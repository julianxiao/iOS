iOS
===

Started working on the Mac back in 2008. Before then, it was mostly Windows - Win32 API, MFC, .NET to WPF. Dabbed with Java and Flash/Flex/Air along the way. But iPhone changed all that. The first project was the [iPhotobook app](AutoPhotoBook_IPhone). Then a weekend project led to the [WordDot](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/worddot-random-name-phrase/id379826534) in the app store. And then many more [other](http://youtu.be/Cgkdc2p7kdY) projects ...
